Hyprland-Dots v2.2.2

1.) Suggest not to rename any files in this folder. As this is connected and being sourced from hyprland.conf in ~/.config/hypr

2.) This folder, along with UserScripts folder will NOT be touch during update.

3.) However, if hyprland has a big change in settings, i.e., blur section is moved into another group, you should managed the change.

4.) Guidance on the keybinds. Suggest NOT to assign a keybind which I set on the default Keybinds. Else will conflict. Once Hyprland decided to have a global keybinds, then I will adjust.

5.) If you think that the default keybinds SHOULD be adjusted, open an issue on my github page and present me a valid argument. Like conflicting to GLOBAL keybinds, etc etc etc.


I will update the Hyprland-Dots wiki for guidance. Make sure to check out changelogs as well
