# CONS of doing this, is that you need to set up your wallpaper (SUPER W) and choose wallpaper.
# CAVEATS! Sometimes the Main Laptop Monitor DOES NOT have display that it needs to re-connect your external monitor
# One work around is to ensure that before shutting down laptop, MAKE SURE your laptop lid is OPEN!!
