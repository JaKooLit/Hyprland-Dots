# NOTE: THIS IS NOT BEING SOURCED by hyprland
# It is only here as a guide if you want to do it manually
# The file you should edit is ~/.config/hypr/workspaces.conf
# Since that is the work space rules being sourced by hyprland
# use nwg-displays to handle your workspace rules.

# You can set workspace rules to achieve workspace-specific behaviors. 
# For instance, you can define a workspace where all windows are drawn without borders or gaps.
