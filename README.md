## 💥 Copying / Installation / Update instructions 💥
- [`MORE INFO HERE`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/2.-Install-&-update) 
- Note! The auto copy script will create backups of intended folders to be copied. However, still a good idea to manually backup just incase script failed to backup!
- ~/.config (btop cava dunst hypr kitty rofi swappy swaylock waybar wlogout) - These are folders to be copied.
- ~/Pictures/wallpapers - Will be backed up
- clone this repo by using git. Change directory, make executable and run the script
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots.git
cd Hyprland-Dots
```
- to copy/install/update from upstream (possible bugs)
```bash
chmod +x copy.sh
./copy.sh
```
- to copy/install/update from releases (more "stable")
```bash
chmod +x release.sh
./release.sh
```

### 🛎️ a small note on wallpapers
- by default, only few wallpapers will be copied (1 each dark and light plus 2 more). You will be offered to download more wallpapers. You can preview/check the additional wallpapers on [`THIS`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Wallpaper-Bank/tree/main/wallpapers) Link


### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ A MUST! after copying  / Installing the dots

+ By default I have not set a wallpaper. Press SUPER W and set a wallpaper. This is also to initiate pywal for waybar, kitty (tty) and rofi themes. If you use the copy.sh script, you wont need to do this.

+ Nvidia Owners. Make sure to edit your ~/.config/hypr/configs/ENVariables.conf if you have set a proper environment already. (recommended). WLR_NO_CURSORS will be activated if nvidia gpu is detected.

+ If you have already set your own keybinds, monitors, etc.... Just copy over from backup created before log-out or reboot. (recommended)

### 🙋 QUESTIONS ?!?! ⁉️
- FAQ! Yes you can use these dotfiles to other distro! Just ensure to install proper packages first! If it makes you feel better, I use same config on my Gentoo and NixOS :)
- QUICK HINT! Click the HINT! Waybar module (note only available in Waybar default and Simple-L [TOP] layout). Can be launched by Keybind SUPER H
- More question? click here [WIKI](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/)

### 🙏 Special request
- If you have improvements on the dotfiles or configuration, feel free to submit a PR for improvement. I always welcome improvements as I am also just learning just like you guys!
- Waybar styles (all those new panel styles require some tweaking) - I kindly request assistance 🙏

### 🤷‍♂️ TO DO!
- [ ] Tweak waybar layouts and Themes
- [ ] Tweak rofi layouts and Themes
- ~~[ ] Quite possibly switch to starship? Although starship has limited themes compared to oh-my-zsh.~~ no plans for now
